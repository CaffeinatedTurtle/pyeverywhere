Adding Native Functionality to PyEverywhere
*******************************************

PyEverywhere wraps a native library on each platform it supports, and using
those libraries, you can expose any native functionality they provide. Their website
contains documentation on how to use them.

iOS
===

On iOS we use Pythonista, which allows you to embed Python and includes Python
wrappers for many native APIs.

Don't forget to check out the `iOS App`_ either!

Android
========

On Android, we use Kivy along with the Android scripting layer to access native functionality.

Mac
===

On Mac, we use wxPython to provide native functionality.
