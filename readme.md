**PyEverywhere**

PyEverywhere is a framework for developing cross-platform applications that run on iOS, Android, Windows Desktop and Mac OS X. Application logic is written using Python, and the application UI is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This allows application developers to leverage the rich and extensive functionality provided by Python APIs and libraries, while taking advantage of the fast and widely available web engines to quickly prototype a usable app UI.

It also supports client / server communications with any JSON-based REST API for cloud-based functionality and syncing.
